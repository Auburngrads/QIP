## R Markdown

The value the content contributed to an educational repository can be determined by several factors

1) Limitations imposed by the enclosing environment

2) Logistic requirements to ensure faculty can create, update and integrate the content

3) 

3) How easily the content can be updated

2) How easily the content can be integrated by other faculty

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
